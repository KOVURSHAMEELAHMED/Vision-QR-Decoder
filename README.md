An end-to-end application built to automate data extraction from QR codes via static images and live video.
 Key Engineering Wins:
Optimized Performance: Designed a system architecture capable of sub-second decoding for real-time applications.
Environment Resilience: Mastered cross-platform dependency management, resolving complex "Fatal error" bugs and library linking issues.
Theory to Practice: Applied image processing fundamentals to create a production-ready automation tool.
This project was a defining moment in my degree, teaching me that robust software is built on clean environments and efficient code.
